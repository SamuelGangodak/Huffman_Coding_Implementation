## Introduction
Huffman coding is a popular algorithm used for lossless data compression.The algorithm assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters, resulting in efficient compression.
## Program Structure 
### File Description
* `Bitstream.h` : Manages operations at the bit level to manipulate compressed data.

* `Heap_function.h` : Handles the dynamic heap utilized in building the Huffman tree.

* `Node.h` : This includes functions for creating links between nodes and determining binary equivalents.

*  `String_builder.h`  : Offers functionality to dynamically construct strings.

* `charMap.h` : Manages the mapping of character frequencies for Huffman encoding.

* `main.c` : Contains the main function

## Implementation Scope : 
The current implementation of Huffman Coding is primarily concentrated on the encoding functionality.
## Usage
### Compilation 

To compile the code, open the project in CLion and build the specified target

### Execution
To execute the code, run the target file.


## Implementation Details :
### How Huffman Coding Works
#### 1. `Frequency Calculation`:
 Count the frequency of each character in the input data.

#### 2. `Tree Construction`: 
Build a Huffman tree using a priority queue or a min-heap.

#### 3. `Code Assignment`: 
Traverse the Huffman tree to assign binary codes to each character.

#### 4. `Encoding`: 
Encode the input data using the generated Huffman codes.

## Applications of Huffman Coding

Huffman coding, renowned for its efficient compression capabilities, finds diverse applications across various domains:

* `Data Compression in File Systems`: Huffman coding is employed in compression algorithms such as ZIP, GZIP, and DEFLATE, effectively reducing file sizes. This not only conserves disk space but also facilitates quicker file transfers.

* `Image and Video Compression`: Huffman coding plays a crucial role in image formats like JPEG and video compression standards such as MPEG. It efficiently compresses multimedia data, enabling the storage and transmission of high-quality images and videos while conserving bandwidth.

* `Network Communication`: Huffman coding aids in efficient data transfer over networks by reducing the sizes of messages or packets. This results in decreased bandwidth usage and faster transmission speeds, which is particularly beneficial in internet communication and data exchange.

* `Text Compression in Databases`: In databases, Huffman coding is utilized to compress textual data. By reducing the storage footprint of text, it enables faster querying and processing of data, optimizing database performance.

* `Encryption and Security`: In certain cases, Huffman coding is incorporated into encryption processes as part of the encoding phase before encryption. While not primarily a security measure itself, it can contribute to overall security by compressing data before encryption, potentially making it less susceptible to certain types of attacks.

These applications underscore the versatility and importance of Huffman coding in various technological domains, where efficient data compression is essential for storage, communication, and processing efficiency.
